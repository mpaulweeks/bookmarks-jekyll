Many television series or movies are elevated by their soundtracks. After a recent re-watch of Gunbuster, I couldn't get [Noriko's catchy theme](https://youtu.be/lNtnlecG9y0) out of my head. And listening to it over and over recalled the bittersweet feelings of the show's emotional twists and heroic climax.

So consider my disappointment when I watched Diebuster soon after, only to be struck by how the sequel's music left me feeling...well, almost nothing! The score was always thematically appropriate, but it mostly blended into the background and failed to make a lasting impression (outside of the conspicuously out-of-place quoting of the [retro, bombastic Gunbuster theme](https://youtu.be/GFppdq6vEPg?t=19s)). The contrast only made me appreciate Gunbuster that much more.

Which got me thinking: How many times have I watched a movie or show, only to find myself listening to its soundtrack on loop the follow week? In almost all cases, it retroactively boosts my appreciation for the original work. Everytime I listen to [Diva from Blood+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3uaUfuYMRI) or [Shangri-la from Noein](https://youtu.be/NLYXYjruLFw), it generates nostalgia for an otherwise forgettable series. Not to mention catchy OPs or inserts, which on repeat listens inevitably erode criticism or misgivings I had about the source material (looking at you, [Kiznaiver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFedqiw-1pc)).

However, this fondess for music is largely due to the music itself, regardless of its narrative significance or usage. Noriko's theme from earlier stood out more than anything from Diebuster due to its clear melodic hook, but how much was that the music itself versus its application to the show? Consider this anecdote: in my early love of Escaflowne and Cowboy Bebop, I decided to seek out anything and everything composed by Yoko Kanno. I now regularly listen to and enjoy the soundtracks for both Brain Powerd and Turn A Gundam despite having never seen either show.

Today, I don't want to take about those songs or try to describe why they appeal to me with awkward metaphors. I want to talk about when a show or film's score works with the action on screen to create something together that's wonderous and unique. I want to dive into motifs and their importance to our connection with the characters and themes.

I want to talk about Ping Pong the Animation. SPOILERS AHEAD!

Ping Pong already has a strong backing score. The music often matches the emotion of the scene, from pumped-up action to quiet sadness.

Each main character has an easily distinguishable musical motif, that generally follows them through their arc.

  <video file="e03_sakuma_intro.mp4"></video>
</div>

Some characters even have multiple themes for different scenarios, connected via a similar melody or instrumentation. Kong's character theme is bouncy, foreign, and proud. When playing a match, the second theme reflects his cut-throat desire to win and razor-sharp focus.

Compare this to Koizumi, whose piano arpeggios reflect an old man's wisdom. When things get competitive, the key switches to the minor mode. The arpeggios have become foreboding and dissonant as he tries to teach Smile a bitter lesson.

That said, as impressive and effective as these motifs are, nothing compares to the Hero's theme and how it is set up, reinforced, then paid off.

The first episode has to a do a lot of heavy lifting fast, both to establish the broad cast of characters and seed the themes that will run thorough the show. Starting in the cold open and then mixed throughout the episode, we see glimpses of the hero. "Chant his name three times, then he will appear!"

In what seems unrelated on first viewing, Smile hums a simple tune a few times in the episode. After getting skunked by Kong in the episode's climax, Peco asks Smile about the song:

<video file="e01_hero_theme.mp4"></video>

> Peco: What's that?
>
> Smile: Monster Robot
>
> Peco: I mean the song.
>
> Smile: Is it weird?
>
> Peco: A little.

Spoilers: Peco doesn't recognize his own theme song. He's lost sight of what drove him as a child and made him the hero. More on this later.

The reinforcement comes during Smile's tournament match vs Kong Wenge in episode 3. At this point, Koizumi has convinced Smile to start practicing and has begun cultivating Smile's competitive edge. That said, keep in mind that Smile has not yet transformed fully into the ruthless robot that defeats Sakuma just two episodes later.

Using an unfamiliar paddle, Smile starts of his match with Konge at a big disadvantage and quickly loses the first game. However, Smile doesn't appear upset, nor is his coach Koizumi worried. As Smile starts to make his comeback, we hear him humming the same tune from episode 1. He is focused, he is trying, and he's having fun.

<video file="e03_humming.mp4"></video>

The stronger Smile gets, the more at peace he seems. He is approaching enlightenment, while Peco as spectator becomes jealous and confused. Peco doesn't recognize his friend Smile. Peco was supposed to be the hero, right? After getting skunked by Kong just two episodes prior, Peco's only words are:

> No way... Is [Smile] going to win?

The final turn of this battle is when an already demoralized Kong Wenge gets chewed out by his coach, who is also his translator and only friend. Smile cannot understand the language but clearly gets the stakes. The humming stops, and a sudden shift in the music accompanies a claustrophoic zoom. Smile's not having fun any more.

<video file="e03_yelling_zoom.mp4"></video>

Immediately, Smile loses his drive to win and sloppily hands the game to Kong. Like his many games with Peco over the years, he can't help but take pity on someone who bases their life around Ping Pong.

<video file="e03_creepy.mp4"></video>

After this match and Koizumi's strong scolding, Smile quickly transforms fully into the "emotionless" robot. For the next several episodes, he doesn't hesistate to crush even former friends like Sakuma. Witnessing this, and feeling left behind, Peco is finally so discouraged he throws away his ping pong paddle.

<video file="e05_paddle.mp4"></video>

With Peco hitting rock bottom in his own existential crisis, it's fitting that the Hero's Theme completely disappears for these middle episodes. So what will it take to bring it back?

With a peptalk from Sakuma and an off-screen epiphany (later revealed to be Smile's enthusiastic grin in an old photo), Peco throws himself into training. He is finding himself again, but has not regained Hero status just yet. In the climatic tournament of the series, we see him breeze through his early opponents. Peco gets a cathartic rematch with Kong Wenge in episode 8 that also serves to conclude Kong's arc.

Smile can't help but notice that Peco, his childhood hero, has finally returned.

<video file="e08_peco_returns.mp4"></video>

> Welcome back, hero.

But we don't hear Hero's theme for another two episodes. Why? Because Peco is still missing something, and he hasn't figured it out yet.

It is during the semi-finals match against Kazama that Peco is truly tested. After quicking losing 4 points in a very convincing fashion, Peco thinks this is his lowest point. His triumphant moment! He openly declares the start of his comeback.

<video file="e10_false_return.mp4"></video>

He announces the Hero's arrival, only to be immediately shut down and then lectured. Kazama, a veteran burdened by his success, can't stomach Peco's naivete. This false start is important, and shows that Peco is still immature, egoistic, and unaware. He continues to struggle and quickly loses the first two games.

Finally, at his lowest point, Peco remembers that key bit of wisdom from his childhood. It's not about being the best, the strongest, the hero. It's so much more pure than that! It turns out... Ping Pong is fun!

<video file="e10_peco_epiphany.mp4"></video>

During this epiphany, we hear Smile's old humming tune slowly fade in. We see a flashback that explains its origins â€“ Smile wrote it for Peco, as the Hero's theme! But as recently as episode 1, Peco had forgotten it. Now through flashback, we hear the original rendition through the voice of a child.

The theme has been setup, reinforced, and reincorporated. But now for the real payoff.

Up until this point, Peco hasn't had a definable song that was his own. His scenes either highlighted another character's theme or borrowed from the standard library of background score. This is the true payoff of the show. On the official soundtrack, this song is titled simply, "Peco".

<video file="e10_peco_theme.mp4"></video>

Hero Kenzan! The action zips by. The background and spectators, even the colors, start to fade as the two players become increasingly focused and wholly absorbed by the game. And nowhere is this sudden transformation as clear and apparent as in the score.

Peco's theme is exploding with sincere exuberance. It's the same melody we heard from Smile earlier, but apply a faster tempo and interesting percussion, and it transforms into a spontaneous assault of sounds. Peco's theme is childish, with the squeaking flute and bells and whistles. Peco's theme is spirited, with the vocal ooo-ing and echoing and the occasional clapping on the beat. Peco's theme is solid and powerful, with the electronic drone to center the chord alongside the strong percussive beat.

Even more, we can appreciate this song's different manifestations / interpretations / arrangements as reflections of each character. Peco's theme mirrors his best qualities and aspirations (as described above), while Smile's slower lullaby more acurately represent his needs: the hero as protector and savior, an answer to the external noise and bullying, less a drug and more a salve.

<video file="e10_smile_hero.mp4"></video>

What I love in particular about this motif is how it transitions from diagetic to non-diagetic, ie from occuring within the reality of the show to outside it. Smile's humming is diagetic, because the characters are aware of it, versus the backing score, which is purely for our benefit and exists outside of the narrative.

Motifs can be powerful things, for building emotional connections to the art or baking narrative associations into the subtext. But so rarely so you see a motif modified, let alone "adapted", like the Hero's theme in Ping Pong. Not only was it expertly set up both in timing and secrecy, but the moment when understand and emotion come together in the narrative and the score synthesizes in response is unprecedented and deeply powerful. When the melody moves from the diagetic humming of a child's fantasy to the pulsating soundtrack of the big match, so does the story of the Hero transform into legend.

### Post Script and Further Reading

- Going back to my opening bit about Gunbuster vs Diebuster, Every Frame a Painting did an excellent video essay called [The Marvel Symphonic Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs) wherein he investigates why western movie soundtracks "seem less memorable these days".
- For a quick primer on Diagesis, check out this segment Linday Ellis made for her review of the [Phantom of the Opera film adaptation](https://youtu.be/-m5I_5Vnh6A?t=5m56s).
- Lindsay Ellis also briefly discusses motif and it's noticeable misuse in the first Hobbit film in her video essay [The Hobbit: A Long-Expected Autopsy](https://youtu.be/uTRUQ-RKfUs?t=31m17s). The motif bit is timestamped, but the video and it's followups are well worth your time.

If you have a favorite show or movie, where you feel the score greatly elevated the storytelling, please drop me a line <a href="https://twitter.com/mpaulweeks">@mpaulweeks</a>! I'd love to hear about it.
