Whenever I have a friend who's trying to get into EDH for the first time and they ask for my advice on deckbuilding.

Now, I have all sorts of opinions on deck building, which I hope to write about further. But if they're just starting off, I don't want to stymie their creativity and potential hurt their interest in the format. The worst thing for a new player to do, in any game, is focus prematurely on what's "top tier" or "meta" instead of exploring the format and having fun.

That said, I like to give my friends four gentle suggestions:

1. Don't play 4 or 5 color
2. Don't play mono White
3. Don't play mono Red
4. Don't play colorless (eg <card-text name="Kozilek, Butcher of Truth"></card-text>)
4. Don't play Red/White

Let's go through those in order, shall we?

## Don't play 4 or 5 color

I lump these together because they have the same core problem: the mana is just too tough.

If you're just starting out in EDH, you probably don't have the goofy singleton mana base already on hand. Outside of a ramp or rock gimmick, you tend to need some combination of:
- a full suite of fetches + duals/shocks/tangos/etc
- all 10 trilands
- all 5 Vivids
- some assortment of one-off all color lands like <card-image name="City of Brass"></card-image>
- a bunch of two-color lands to fill in the gaps

...and half of those options come into play tapped. You can pretty easily get a working 3 color mana base on your first try, but 4-5 colors turns your mana base into a deck building decision, when you should be focusing on more interesting stuff like deck themes, threats, and answers

## Don't play mono White

EDH is (generally) a slower format, where long-term card advantage really matters. You want to have lots of options late into the game after the fifth wrath has gone off. But to maximize those options, you need to have spent some time early/mid game accelerating your mana.

Basically, the two most important things in EDH are Draw and Mana. I don't think that's a terribly controversial statement.

Now, every deck can run artifacts. For better or worse, the good artifact options for Draw tend are limited and slow. Artifacts provide great Mana acceleration and fixing with rocks, but thanks to color identity rules, your options are limited the less colors your deck. For example, the Signets are some of the best ramp cards for their speed and fixing. This is how many you can run in your deck depending on your number of colors:

- 0 colors: 0
- 1 color:  0
- 2 colors: 1
- 3 colors: 3
- 4 colors: 6
- 5 colors: 10

The fewer colors your running, the less options you have for artifact ramp, and you have to start digging into slower options like <card-text name="Fire Dimaond"></card-text> or less useful ones like <card-text name="Fractured Powerstone"></card-text>

All this is to say: a mono colored deck doesn't get much help from artifacts in fulfilling the two core needs of a deck: Draw and Mana. Which is fine, depending on what the color brings to the table
