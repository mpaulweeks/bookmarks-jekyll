Type 4 is a multiplayer variant format for Magic: The Gathering

There is a great wiki article on [Gamepedia](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Type_4) with more details and history

Described here are my house rules for playing Type 4. _Last updated: February 2018_

## Setup

- Divide the entire stack into X equal-sized piles, where X is the number of players. Each player takes a pile. That is now their deck

- Cards that were in your deck at the beginning of the game are owned by you for the rest of the game

  - Cards retrieved from outside the game (eg <card-text name="Booster Tutor"></card-text>) are owned by you for the rest of the game, and then removed

- Each player starts the game with 5 cards in hand. First player draws on their turn. No mulligans

## The Rules

- You have unlimited mana at all times. You may activate a card like <card-text name="Legacy Weapon"></card-text> as many times as you like

- You may only cast one spell per turn (think <card-text name="Arcane Laboratory"></card-text>)

- If the spell is "free", and didn't cost you any mana to cast, it doesn't count towards your one-spell limit. This can happen with:

  - alternate costs like <card-text name="Force of Will"></card-text>
  - another card made it free, like Cascade or <card-text name="Djinn of Wishes"></card-text>
  - it cost 0 mana to cast, like the conditional timings of <card-text name="Summoning Trap"></card-text> or <card-text name="Not of This World"></card-text>
  - Note: paying an additional cost like Kicker is both legal and encouraged, the spell is still considered "free"

## FAQ

- Suspend is an activated ability. When the card comes out of suspend and gets cast, it’s free. Therefore, a suspended card will never count towards your 1 spell per turn

- If you cycle a card that has a triggered ability, you get the draw from the cycle after resolving the ability (cycling goes on the stack first, trigger goes on top)

### Does this count as a spell?

- The following DOES count as casting a spell:
  - Flashback
- The following DOES NOT count as casting a spell:
  - Cycling
  - Channel
  - Bloodrush
  - Unearth

### When I cast something for free...

- The following DOES WORK when casting free spells:
  - Kicker
  - Buyback
- The following DOES NOT WORK when casting free spells:
  - Morph
  - Cycling
  - Channel
  - Bloodrush

## Card Specific

- Both the cards <card-text name="Spelljack"></card-text> and <card-text name="Kheru Spellsnatcher"></card-text> give you the spell to cast for the rest of the game, even if Kheru dies. You must obey the casting timing of that card (ie Sorcery vs Instant speed)

- If you cast <card-text name="Corpse Dance"></card-text> during the end step, the creature sticks around until the end of the next turn

- Defensive/reactive activations, like <card-text name="Azorius Guildmage"></card-text>'s second ability, win all "ties"

  - eg: <card-text name="Smokespew Invoker"></card-text> vs <card-text name="Thornling"></card-text> increasing it's toughness: Thornling lives

- Monstrosity always gets a chance to resolve while the creature is still on the battlefield and under it’s current controller’s control

  - eg: <card-text name="Stormbreath Dragon"></card-text> vs <card-text name="Legacy Weapon"></card-text>: Stormbreath is guaranteed the triggered ability

## Errata

I try not have any errate on cards in Type4. This is the one exception

- You cannot use <card-text name="Azorius Guildmage"></card-text>’s second ability to counter the same ability from another <card-text name="Azorius Guildmage"></card-text>
