"Type 4" is a variant of Magic: The Gathering. Think of it like EDH/Commander meets cube draft meets really stupid fun.

Type 4 is played as a limited format using a pre-assembled stack (similar to a cube). You can draft from the stack, hand out random chunks like sealed, or simply have everyone play off a shared deck.

Play it just like a normal, multiplayer free-for-all game. Only with two additional rules:

1. You have unlimited mana of all colors at all times
2. You can only play one spell per turn

There is a great wiki article on [Gamepedia](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Type_4) with more details and history

Wizards has also ran articles on the format back in [2004](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/limited-infinity-2004-03-01) and [2009](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/fourth-type-2009-07-28), both with fun play-by-plays. Highly recommended!

Described here are my house rules for playing Type 4. _Last updated: February 2018_

## Setup

- Divide the entire stack into X equal-sized piles, where X is the number of players. Each player takes a pile. That is now their deck

- Cards that were in your deck at the beginning of the game are owned by you for the rest of the game

  - Cards retrieved from outside the game (eg <card-text name="Booster Tutor"></card-text>) are owned by you for the rest of the game, and then removed

- Each player starts the game with 5 cards in hand. First player draws on their turn. No mulligans

- Each player starts with 20 life

## The Rules

- You have unlimited mana of all colors at all times

  - You may activate a card like <card-text name="Legacy Weapon"></card-text> as long as there are still targets

- You may only cast one spell each turn (think <card-text name="Arcane Laboratory"></card-text>)

- If the spell is "free", meaning it didn't cost you any mana to cast, it doesn't count towards your one-spell limit. This can happen with:

  - alternate costs like <card-text name="Force of Will"></card-text>
  - another card made it free, like Cascade or <card-text name="Djinn of Wishes"></card-text>
  - it cost 0 mana to cast, like the conditional timings of <card-text name="Summoning Trap"></card-text> or <card-text name="Not of This World"></card-text>
  - Note: paying an additional cost like Kicker is both legal and encouraged, the spell is still considered "free"

## FAQ

- Suspend is an activated ability. When the card comes out of suspend and gets cast, it’s free. Therefore, a suspended card will never count towards your 1 spell per turn

  - eg: <card-text name="Deep-Sea Kraken"></card-text>

- If you cycle a card that has a triggered ability, you get the draw from the cycle after resolving the ability (cycling goes on the stack first, trigger goes on top)

- In the case of "ability wars", the defensive/reactive activation wins out

  - eg: <card-text name="Smokespew Invoker"></card-text> vs <card-text name="Thornling"></card-text> increasing it's toughness: Thornling lives

- Monstrosity always gets a chance to resolve while the creature is still on the battlefield and under it’s current controller’s control

  - eg: <card-text name="Stormbreath Dragon"></card-text> vs <card-text name="Legacy Weapon"></card-text>: Stormbreath is guaranteed the triggered ability

### Does this count as a spell?

- The following DOES count as casting a spell:
  - Flashback
- The following DOES NOT count as casting a spell:
  - Cycling
  - Channel
  - Bloodrush
  - Unearth

### When I cast something for free...

- The following DOES WORK when casting free spells:
  - Kicker
  - Buyback
- The following DOES NOT WORK when casting free spells:
  - Morph
  - Cycling
  - Channel
  - Bloodrush

## Card Specific

- Both the cards <card-text name="Spelljack"></card-text> and <card-text name="Kheru Spellsnatcher"></card-text> give you the spell to cast for the rest of the game (even after Kheru dies). You must still obey the timing restriction of that card (Sorcery vs Instant speed)

- If you cast <card-text name="Corpse Dance"></card-text> during the end step, the creature sticks around until the end of the next turn

## Tips

- Most cards with Cycling are better off being cycled for the draw plus triggered ability

  - eg: <card-text name="Resounding Thunder"></card-text> and <card-text name="Decree of Silence"></card-text>

- The card <card-text name="Benalish Commander"></card-text> is meant to be suspended for X=&infin;, providing a steady stream of chump blockers for the rest of game without tying up a spell cast

## Errata

I try not have any errate on cards in Type4, to ensure it's easy to pickup and play

There is the one exception, both because it's so rare AND game breaking:

- You cannot use <card-text name="Azorius Guildmage"></card-text>’s second ability to counter the same ability from another <card-text name="Azorius Guildmage"></card-text>
