I had to joyous opportunity/excuse to reread My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness for a book club.

When I first read it back in early 2016, I resonating with it strongly. I usually introduced it as the most moving book I read that year.

On a very personal note, I was particularly grateful for the author's brief page or two on self-harm. As someone who was suffered with depression, but never cut, it really helped me to empathize with those who. I'd heard about "being in control of the pain", but her specific observation about externalizing it, and the causal relationship, made it much more relateable.
