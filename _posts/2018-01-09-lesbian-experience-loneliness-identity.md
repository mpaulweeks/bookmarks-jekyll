I had to joyous opportunity/excuse to reread My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness for a book club.

When I first read it back in early 2016, it resonating with me immediately. I would introduce it as the most emotionally affecting book I read that year.

My goto example was the author's brief page or two on self-harm. As someone who was suffered with depression, but was never driven to cut, it really helped me to empathize with those who have. I'd heard about "being in control of the pain", but her specific observation about externalizing it, and creating a visible causal relationship, made it much more relatable.

The author finally achieves actualization through self-acceptance. Yes, this is inextricably tied to the manga's success and the subsequent audience filling her need for connection, but she achieved similar external validation during her debut to no avail.

This time was different, in part because her autobiographical work was so tied to her identity. Her TRUE identity.

Now, this is not completely naive. It's not as trite as "be yourself". On the way she made significant changes and self-investments.

For all of her angst leading up to it, and ennui immediately afterwards, her initial visit to a prostitute was instrumental in demystifying sex and giving her the experience to channel into her art, and resulting self-exploration on page.

Let's not forget the several pages on personal hygiene and the realization that (a) it takes work and (b) it's worth it.

## notes

- job is where you belong, jk its a contract
- family expectations, and the cycle of guilt


Goals as fleeting
Job but no validation from parents
Debut but not easier
Sex but still hollow
