The first episode has to a do a lot of heavy lifting fast, both to establish the broad cast of characters and seed the themes that will run thorough the show.

Starting in the cold open and then mixed thorough the episode, we see glimpses of the hero. "Chant his name three times, then he will appear!" Likewise, we can hear Smile humming a simple tune a few times in the episode.

At the end of the episode, Peco comments on the tune in this brief exchange.

Peco doesn't recognize his own theme song, mirroring how he's lost sight of what drove him as a child and made him the hero.

The second time we hear the song is during Smile's tournament match vs Kong Wenge in episode 3. At this point, the coach has convinced him to start practicing and has starting sharpening his competitive edge, but Smile's transformation into the ruthless robot is still in progress.

Smile starts of his match with Konge on the backfoot, but this doesn't discourage him. Yes we see some of the "mechnical" imagery as he downloads his opponent, but the whole time he is humming the same old tune. He is focused, he is trying, and he's having fun.

At strong Smile gets, the more at peace he seems. He is enlightened, and Peco merely is jealous and confused. He doesn't recognize his friend Smile. He was supposed to be the hero, right?

The true turning point of this battle is when, an already demoralized Kong Wenge gets chewed out by his coach, his translator, his friend. Smile hears this (as indicated by an on-the-nose zoom).

Immediately, Smile is shown to lose his drive. Like his many games with Peco, he can't help but go easy on someone who "bases their life around Ping Pong", something he describes to Kazuma in that same episode as "disgusting".

(screenshot)

The show quickly skips to the inevitable conclusion: Smile and hands the game to Kong. Kong accepts the victory but can't help but have his ego bruised. He suspects and resents Smile's pity.

After this match and Koizumi's strong scolding, Smile transforms fully into the "emotionless" robot. For the next several episodes, he doesn't hesistate to crush even former friends like Sakuma.

With Peco hitting rock bottom in his own existential crisis, it's fitting that the Hero's Theme completely disappears. That is, until Peco's enlightenment and return to form.

With a peptalk from Sakuma and off-screen revelation (later revealed to be Smile's enthusiastic grin in an old photo), Peco throws himself into training. He is finding himself again, but has not regained Hero status just yet.

We see him breeze through opponent, getting a cathartic rematch with Kong Wenge in episode 9 that also serves to conclude Kong's arc and show his growth and maturity. But this is still just Peco being Peco.

It is against Kazama that Peco is truly tested. At one point, he thinks this is his triumphant moment, the start of his comeback. He announces the Hero's arrival, only to immediately shut down and then lecturing by Kazama, a burdened warrior who can't stomach Peco's naivete.

Finally, at his lowest point, Peco remembers that key bit of wisdom from his childhood. The defining trait that made him a hero back then. That Ping Pong is fun!

All this buildup culminates in an ecstatic climax. The action zips by. The background and spectators, even the colors, start to fade as the two players become increasingly focused and wholly absorbed by the game. And nowhere is this sudden transformation as clear and apparent as the score.

Hero Kenzan! The Hero Appears, and now we hear _Peco's Theme_ (as titled in the soundtrack) in all it's sincere exuberance. The almost-lullaby tune we heard from Smile earlier turns into this high-energy, spontaneous assault of sounds. Peco's Theme is childish, with the squeaking flute and bells and whistles. Peco's Theme is spirited, with the vocal ooo-ing and echoing and the occasional clapping on the beat. Peco's Theme is solid and powerful, with the electronic drone to center the chrod, alongside the strong percussive beat.

I want to clarify that Peco's Theme as presented in episode 10 is not necessarily the "true version" of the song. Given the logic of the story, and the song's <a href="">non-diagetic presentation</a> (unlike Smile's humming), I prefer the think of the Hero Theme as a simple catchy tune improvised by a child. Continuing this logic, we can appreciate it's different manifestations, interpretations, arrangements, as reflections of each character. Peco's Theme mirrors his best qualities and aspirations, while Smile's slower lullaby more acurately represent his needs: the hero as protector and savior, an answer to the external noise and bullying, less a drug and more a salve.

The visual metaphors continue. Peco's enthusiasm is so infestious it begins infest Kazama, leading to a wonderfully symbolic scene. Kazama is constantly depicted as climbing an infitely tall wall, his monologue in the episode describing the detail the burden of winning. His path has no discrete goal or finish line, only the possibility of failure. Thus when he sees Peco fly past him, he finally ceases the endless climbing and tries something new. He breaks the cycle, and finally sees the hero.

Except the Hero cannot help him directly, only show him the way. Kazama sprouts wings and escapes his self-imposed mental prison. Finally taking flight marks the resolution of another thread, mimiced in the final line of the episode. "People can fly"

Kazama adamantly declares throughout the episode: "people can't fly". This both summarizes his feeling trapped in the cycle of endless victories, as well as deeper emotional trauma surrounding his father. The flashback imply Kazama's father commited by suicide, and this combined with intense familiar pressure to conform to a specific role bind him to the earth.

Yet even as he's about to lose Peco, he no longer cares. Not due to depression or an invalidation of his beliefs, but rather the epiphany that he doesn't have to be shackled. He can be so much more. Life can be so much more. "People really can fly"
