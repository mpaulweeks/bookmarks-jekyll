The first episode has to a do a lot of heavy lifting fast, both to establish the broad cast of characters and seed the themes that will run thorough the show.

Starting in the cold open and then mixed thorough the episode, we see glimpses of the hero. "Chant his name three times, then he will appear!" Likewise, we can hear Smile humming a simple tune a few times in the episode.

At the end of the episode, Peco comments on the tune in this brief exchange.

Peco doesn't recognize his own theme song, mirroring how he's lost sight of what drove him as a child and made him the hero.

The second time we hear the song is during Smile's tournament match vs Kong Wenge in episode 3. At this point, the coach has convinced him to start practicing and has starting sharpening his competitive edge, but Smile's transformation into the ruthless robot is still in progress.

Smile starts of his match with Konge on the backfoot, but this doesn't discourage him. Yes we see some of the "mechnical" imagery as he downloads his opponent, but the whole time he is humming the same old tune. He is focused, he is trying, and he's having fun.

At strong Smile gets, the more at peace he seems. He is enlightened, and Peco merely is jealous and confused. He doesn't recognize his friend Smile. He was supposed to be the hero, right?

The true turning point of this battle is when, an already demoralized Kong Wenge gets chewed out by his coach, his translator, his friend. Smile hears this (as indicated by an on-the-nose zoom).

Immediately, Smile is shown to lose his drive. Like his many games with Peco, he can't help but go easy on someone who "bases their life around Ping Pong", something he describes to Kazuma in that same episode as "disgusting".

The show quickly skips to the inevitable conclusion: Smile and hands the game to Kong. Kong accepts the victory but can't help but have his ego bruised. He suspects and resents Smile's pity.

After this match and Koizumi's strong scolding, Smile transforms fully into the "emotionless" robot. For the next several episodes, he doesn't hesistate to crush even former friends like Sakuma.

With Peco hitting rock bottom in his own existential crisis, it's fitting that the Hero's Theme completely disappears. That is, until Peco's enlightenment and return to form.

With a peptalk from Sakuma and off-screen revelation (later revealed to be Smile's enthusiastic grin in an old photo), Peco throws himself into training. He is finding himself again, but has not regained Hero status just yet.

We see him breeze through opponent, getting a cathartic rematch with Kong Wenge in episode 9 that also serves to conclude Kong's arc and show his growth and maturity. But this is still just Peco being Peco.

It is against Kazama that Peco is truly tested. At one point, he thinks this is his triumphant moment, the start of his comeback. He announces the Hero's arrival, only to immediately shut down and then lecturing by Kazama, a burdened warrior who can't stomach Peco's naivete.

Finally, at his lowest point, Peco remembers that key bit of wisdom from his childhood. The defining trait that made him a hero back then. That Ping Pong is fun!

All this buildup culminates in an ecstatic climax. The action zips by. The background and spectators, even the colors, start to fade as the two players become increasingly focused and wholly absorbed by the game. And nowhere is this sudden transformation as clear and apparent as the score.

Hero Kenzan! The Hero Appears, and now we hear his theme in all it's sincere exuberance. The almost-lullaby tune we heard from Smile earlier turns into this high-energy, spontaneous assault of sounds. Peco's Theme is childish, with the squeaking flute and bells and whistles. Peco's Theme is spirited, with the vocal ooo-ing and echoing and the occasional clapping on the beat. Peco's Theme is solid and powerful, with the electronic drone to center the chrod, alongside the strong percussive beat.

Peco's enthusiasm is so infestious it begins infest Kazama, leading to a wonderfully symbolic scene. Kazama is constantly depicted as climbing this infitely tall wall

berates peco for flying
dad suicide
then grows wings
peco will show the way but he needs to find the strength
grows his wings and flys
