When deciding to make a new EDH deck, I judge prospective Commanders on the following criteria

They must be:

- Is cheap to cast

They must be one of the following:

- Provide value before my next turn
- Very hard to remove
- Play good politics / represent low threat level

Commander is ultimately a format about both variance and consistency. We get to pick a Commander, who comes out every game. Yet our remaining 99 is singleton.

My ideal Commander deck has the same rough gameplan every time I play, but the texture and details, the journey, vary depending on what I draw.

Let's look at my current 16 commanders and see how they shape their decks and made the cut.

## Commander as Passive Buff

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Ephara, God of the Polis</auto-card-image>
</div>

- Is cheap to cast
- Very hard to remove
- Plays good politics / low threat level

My Ephara deck is a strong build-around. It seeks to run out a Rebel and Ephara by Turn 4, then spend the rest of the game playing control and using Ephara as a reliable source of card draw.

The deck strongly relies on Ephara for the cards, and it generally works for 3 reasons:
- Ephara comes out early, and doesn't cost tempo in later turns when I need to be answering threats
- Ephara is rarely a creature, so very few removal spells can even hit her
- Compared to cards like <auto-card>Rhystic Study</auto-card>, she flies a low profile and tends to avoid the few spells that could remove her, like <auto-card>Return to Dust</auto-card>

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Mogis, God of Slaughter</auto-card-image>
</div>

- Is cheap to cast
- Provide value before my next turn
- Very hard to remove

Mogis on the other hand is merely on-theme.

He's a solid play for his low cost and relevant body (the many enchantments in the 99 often give me devotion, 7 power is relevant!), but at the end of the day, he is one of many "slug" effects in the deck.

He has a cute synergy with <auto-card>Pestilence</auto-card> and similar cards, but if he gets <auto-card name="Sond of Dryads">turned into a Forest</auto-card>, it's not the end of the world.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Inalla, Archmage Ritualist</auto-card-image>
</div>

- Is cheap to cast
- Very hard to remove

I never cast Inalla. She just sits in my Command-zone like an emblem and allows me to clone my many wizards (or the occasional <auto-card name="Arcane Adaptation">adapted</auto-card> <auto-card name="Grey Merchant of Asphodel">Gary</auto-card>)

She effectively costs 0, is impossible to remove, and provided value all game. Meanwhile the wizards (or <auto-card name="Conspiracy">soon to be wizards</auto-card>) vary greatly in effect. All resulting in a deck that can very consistently clone creatures for their ETBs!

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Sygg, River Cutthroat</auto-card-image>
</div>

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Nezahal, Primal Tide</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Commander as Spell

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Prime Speaker Zegana</auto-card-image>
</div>

- Has guaranteed payoff before my next turn

The patron saint of UG. My Zegana deck revolves around <auto-card>Maro</auto-card> cards and effects. The line of play looks like this:

1. Ramp heavily
2. Play <auto-card name="Sturmgeist">Maro-type</auto-card> card
3. Cast Zegana or <auto-card name="Soul's Majesty">other "power matters" draw spell</auto-card>
4. This doubles my hand size
5. Repeat step 3-4

At 6 cmc, I wouldn't call Zegana cheap, but for how much this deck ramps, it's not bad. It's also basically on rate, with the redundant copies of that effect elsewhere in my deck costing 5-6 mana.

So if I want a hand-size matters, why not run <auto-card>Tishana, Voice of Thunder</auto-card>? It's because the strategy requires two types of cards: Maro + power draw spell. There have been a lot of Maros printed in the last 25 years of Magic, so I can run enough in the 99 to ensure I always find one. That's not the case for the draw spells.

Being able to rely on Zegana for that extra redundancy is essential, but I still run the alternatives in case she gets stuck on the table or I get slapped with a <auto-card>Nevermore</auto-card>.
