Last night I got to try the <auto-card name="Azorius Chancery">Karoo</auto-card> / <auto-card name="Jodah, Archmage Eternal">Jodah</auto-card> deck I highlighted [last week](/edh-karoo).

After taking complete control of the game and drawing my entire deck in one turn, I realized I hated it!

# Breakdown

Piloting the deck, and seeing essentially the best possible game, I realized three core problems:

1. No win condition. I thought I had something, like a <auto-card>Psychosis Crawler</auto-card> to combo with the <auto-card>Tatyova, Benthic Druid</auto-card>, but after drawing my whole deck and generating 40+ mana, the best/worst I could do was cast <auto-card>Windfall</auto-card> with my giant hand to murder-suicide another player
2. Really long solitaire turns. I'm going to blame this on the "untappers", which really complicated the mana math. Even though they're clearly good for my deck, I'm looking to remove them + similar cards to reduce the amount of play decisions
3. Mana flood. Early on, I accomplished a nice one-sided lockout by casting <auto-card>Cyclonic Rift</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sunder</auto-card> in the same turn. As hoped, I was able to dump my lands back in quickly, only to discover that I had literally no other plays for about 5 turns. I nearly killed one player with Jodah, but we should be able to do better

All of my changes seek to fix these problems. The broad strokes, the solutions are:

1. Swap Jodah for the efficient win condition known as <auto-card>Progenitus</auto-card>
2. Remove all untappers and tutors (except for one card that I'll explain below)
3. Add all the wheels and any big draw spells to make sure I don't flood out

## Cutting the Untappers

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Frantic Search</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Treachery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Time Spiral</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Candelabra of Tawnos</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Garruk Wildspeaker</auto-card-image>
</div>

These cards are strong, no doubt. But they inevitably create longer turns and mana math, and their impact besides ramping is either minor or not in line with the deck's strategy (except of course <auto-card>Time Spiral</auto-card>, but I'm trying to take a hard line here).

They are also the only way for my deck to generate net positive mana the turn they're cast, versus <auto-card>Exploration</auto-card>-type cards that are usually an investment and at best break even. By removing them, I will more reliably have finite mana and actually end my god damn turn.

## Cutting the One-Shot Explorations

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Summer Bloom</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Broken Bond</auto-card-image>
</div>

With the addition of <auto-card>Wayward Swordtooth</auto-card>, I'm at 14 land acceleration cards. I don't think I need these. <auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card> has the same "net-positive mana" problem I was trying to avoid above and <auto-card>Broken Bond</auto-card> is too low impact to justify when I don't need the land ramp.

## Adding more Wheels / Big Draw

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Reforge the Soul</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Timetwister</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Time Reversal</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Commit / Memory</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Diminishing Returns</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Temporal Cascade</auto-card-image>
</div>

Pretty straightforward. I dump my lands, use the aggresive ramping to dump my hand, then wheel. Keep going until I can remove everyone's board + resolve <auto-card>Progenitus</auto-card> in one turn.

I was originally shy towards wheels that reshuffled my graveyard, considering how much graveyard land recursion I run. But a card like <auto-card>Crucible of Worlds</auto-card> is good enough with a single fetch.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Recurring Insight</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Knowledge Exploitation</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Notion Thief</auto-card-image>
</div>

There are only so many wheels. <auto-card>Recurring Insight</auto-card> isn't a wheel, but it's most efficient "big draw" spell, and I can assume my opponents have healthy hands given how many other wheels I run. <auto-card>Knowledge Exploitation</auto-card> is essentially another wheel, since at least one person in my playgroup is usually running either <auto-card>Wheel of Fortune</auto-card> or <auto-card>Windfall</auto-card>.

Lastly, <auto-card>Notion Thief</auto-card> is just too tempting with all these wheels going around.

## Cutting the Tutors

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Wargate</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Fabricate</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Trinket Mage</auto-card-image>
</div>

With all the wheels, I should be seeing enough of my deck such that tutoring isn't really necessary. Yes, I'd like to see <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> in every game, but I'm also okay with my deck playing a little differently each time (I already have an absurd amount of redundancy elsewhere).

Note: I am keeping <auto-card>Bring to Light</auto-card>, but only because I view it as another wheel.

## Cutting the Medium-sized Draw

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Fact or Fiction</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Painful Truths</auto-card-image>
</div>

These are just outclasses by the wheels. <auto-card>Painful Truths</auto-card> is especially mediocre without <auto-card name="Jodah, Archmage Eternal">Jodah</auto-card>.

## Adding Mass Bounce

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Coastal Breach</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Aether Gale</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Displacement Wave</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Devastation Tide</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Crush of Tentacles</auto-card-image>
</div>

The most reliable way to reset the board is mass bounce. It hits everything but lands, whereas even cards like <auto-card>Planar Cleansing</auto-card> fail to answer <auto-card>Darksteel Ingot</auto-card> or <auto-card>Purphoros, God of the Forge</auto-card>.

My few permanents that would get bounces are cheap Exploration effects, and are quick to replay. Mass bounce also becomes permanent "removal" when I can line it up with a wheel.

## Cutting the Old Removal

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Decree of Pain</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Dread Cacodemon</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>In Garruk's Wake</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>By Force</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Decimate</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Merciless Eviction</auto-card-image>
</div>

These just cost more and/or do less than mass bounce effects. Remember, I'm no longer getting the discount from <auto-card name="Jodah, Archmage Eternal">Jodah</auto-card>.

## Cutting Dead Weight

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Constant Mists</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Natural Balance</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Balancing Act</auto-card-image>
</div>

If this deck is as oppressive as I think it is, I really don't need to bother with <auto-card>Fog</auto-card> effects, regardless of how good they are.

I was excited about the other two in my previous article, but I just ramp out way more lands than I expected. I reset too often for <auto-card>Natural Balance</auto-card> to reliably hurt my opponents, and I get so many lands in play that <auto-card>Balancing Act</auto-card> hurts me the most.

## Add More Land Destruction

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Armageddon</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Decree of Annihilation</auto-card-image>
</div>

Now that my game plan is explicitly "reset + threat", it's good to have more of these. <auto-card>Decree of Annihilation</auto-card> is there more for the cycling, but I could see casting it too if it's endgame.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Heroic Intervention</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sylvan Awakening</auto-card-image>
</div>

Given that I have more land destruction, why not try to make it completely one-sided? These are an experiment, and will be quick cuts if they don't line up or feel too win-more.

## Add More Win Cons

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Concordant Crossroads</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rampaging Baloths</auto-card-image>
</div>

I'm quite happy with my Progenitus plan, but just in case, I added these two cards to potentially end the game in one turn.

With just one bounce land still in hand, <auto-card>Rampaging Baloths</auto-card> gets a 4/4 for each land drop I have (the bounce land bounces itself). Last game, that got up to around 8. And like <auto-card>Tatyova, Benthic Druid</auto-card>, it goes infinite with <auto-card>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card> + <auto-card>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card> (or it's many functional reprints)

## Other Thoughts

You may think <auto-card>Jokulhaups</auto-card> and <auto-card>Obliterate</auto-card> are obvious includes, but I'm not thrilled about hard resets that miss enchantments and planeswalkers. Should I struggle to rebuild my mana, something as common as <auto-card>Ghostly Prison</auto-card> can stop my win-cons completely.

I plan to replace <auto-card>Rampaging Baloths</auto-card> with <auto-card>Omnath, Locus of Rage</auto-card> (or maybe run both) as soon as I get my hands on a copy of the latter.

# Conclusion

I'm excited about the changes I've made, but I'm also very worried that I've made a degenerate, uninteractive, and too-villanous deck. We'll see.

That said, at least now the games should be mercifully shorter!

Until next time, happy brewing!
