Last night I got to try the <auto-card name="Azorius Chancery">Karoo</auto-card> / <auto-card name="Jodah, Archmage Eternal">Jodah</auto-card> deck I highlighted [last week](/edh-karoo).

After taking complete control of the game and drawing my entire deck in one turn, I realized I hated it!

# Breakdown

Piloting the deck, and seeing essentially the best possible game, I realized three core problems:

1. No win condition. I thought I had something, like a <auto-card>Psychosis Crawler</auto-card> to combo with the <auto-card>Tatyova, Benthic Druid</auto-card> / <auto-card>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card> /  but after drawing my whole deck and generating ~40 mana, the best/worst I could do was cast <auto-card>Windfall</auto-card> with my giant hand to murder-suicide another player
2. Really long solitaire turns. I'm going to blame this on the "untappers", which really complicated the mana math. Even though they're clearly good for my deck, I'm looking to remove them + similar cards to reduce the amount of play decisions
3. Mana flood. Early on, I accomplished a nice one-sided lockout by casting <auto-card>Cyclonic Rift</auto-card> and <auto-card>Sunder</auto-card> in the same turn. As hoped, I was able to dump my lands back in quickly, only to discover that I had literally no other plays for about 5 turns. I nearly killed one player with Jodah, but we should be able to do better

All of my changes seek to fix these problems. The solutions are:

1. Swap Jodah for efficient win condition that is <auto-card>Progenitus</auto-card>
2. Remove all untappers and tutors (except for two cards that I'll expand upon below)
3. Add all the wheels and/or big draw. These allow me to dump my lands and refill as fast as possible

## Cutting the Untappers

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Frantic Search</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Treachery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Time Spiral</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Candelabra of Tawnos</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Garruk Wildspeaker</auto-card-image>
</div>

These cards are strong, no doubt. But they inevitably create longer turns and mana math, and their impact besides ramping is either minor or not in line with the deck's strategy. They are also the only way for my deck to generate net positive mana the turn they're cast, versus <auto-card>Exploration</auto-card>-type cards that are usually an investment and at best break even. By removing, I will more reliably have finite mana and actually end my god damn turn.

## Cutting the One-Shot Explorations

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Summer Bloom</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Broken Bond</auto-card-image>
</div>

With the addition of <auto-card>Wayward Swordtooth</auto-card>, I'm at 14 land acceleration cards. I don't think I need these.

<auto-card>Summer Bloom</auto-card> has the same "net-positive mana" problem I was trying to avoid above and <auto-card>Broken Bond</auto-card> is too low impact to justify when I don't need the land ramp.

## Adding more Wheels / Big Draw

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Reforge the Soul</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Timetwister</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Time Reversal</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Commit / Memory</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Diminishing Returns</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Temporal Cascade</auto-card-image>
</div>

Pretty straightforward. I dump my lands, use the aggresive ramping to dump my hand, then wheel. Keep going until I can remove everyone's board + resolve <auto-card>Progenitus</auto-card> in one turn.

I was originally shy towards wheels that reshuffled my graveyard, considering how my graveyard land recursion I run. But the recursion is good enough with a single fetch, and it's nice to be able to recover a discarded combo piece.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Recurring Insight</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Knowledge Exploitation</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Notion Thief</auto-card-image>
</div>

<auto-card>Recurring Insight</auto-card> isn't a wheel, but it's most efficient "big draw" spell, and I can assume my opponents have healthy hands given how many other wheels I run.

<auto-card>Knowledge Exploitation</auto-card> is essentially another wheel, since at least one person in my playgroup is usually running either <auto-card>Wheel of Fortune</auto-card> or <auto-card>Windfall</auto-card>.

<auto-card>Notion Thief</auto-card> is just too tempting with all these wheels going around.

## Cutting the Tutors

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Wargate</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Fabricate</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Trinket Mage</auto-card-image>
</div>

With all the wheels, I should be seeing enough of my deck such that tutoring isn't really necessary. Yes, I'd like to see <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> in every game, but I'm also okay with my deck playing a little differently each time (I already have an absurd amount of redundancy elsewhere).

Note: I am keeping <auto-card>Bring to Light</auto-card>, but only because I view it as another wheel.

## Cutting the Medium-sized Draw

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Fact or Fiction</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Painful Truths</auto-card-image>
</div>

These are just outclasses by the wheels.

## Adding Mass Bounce

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Coastal Breach</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Aether Gale</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Displacement Wave</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Devastation Tide</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Crush of Tentacles</auto-card-image>
</div>

The most reliable way to reset the bounce is will mass bounce. It hits everything but lands, whereas even cards like <auto-card>Hour of Devastation</auto-card> fail to answer <auto-card>Darksteel Ingot</auto-card> or <auto-card>Purphoros, God of the Forge</auto-card>.

My few permanents are cheap Exploration effects, easy to replay. The bounce also becomes permanent "removal" when I can line them up with a wheel.

## Cutting the Old Removal

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Decree of Pain</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Dread Cacodemon</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>In Garruk's Wake</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>By Force</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Decimate</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Merciless Eviction</auto-card-image>
</div>

These just cost more and do less than mass bounce effects. Remember, I'm no longer getting the discount from <auto-card name="Jodah, Archmage Eternal">Jodah</auto-card>.

## Cutting Dead Weight

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Constant Mists</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Natural Balance</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Balancing Act</auto-card-image>
</div>

If this deck is as oppressive as I think it is, I really don't need to bother with <auto-card>Fog</auto-card> effects, regardless of how good they are.

I was excited about the other two, but I just ramp out way more lands than I imagined. I reset too often for <auto-card>Natural Balance</auto-card> to reliably hurt my opponents, and I get so many lands in play that <auto-card>Balancing Act</auto-card> hurts me the most.

## Add More Land Destruction

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Armageddon</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Decree of Annihilation</auto-card-image>
</div>

Now that my game plan is explicitly "reset + threat", it's good to have more of these. <auto-card>Decree of Annihilation</auto-card> is there more for the cycling, but I could see casting it too if it's endgame.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Heroic Intervention</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sylvan Awakening</auto-card-image>
</div>

Given that I have more land destruction, why not try to make it completely on-sided? These are an experiment, and both potential cuts if it doesn't line up and/or isn't necessary.

## Add More Win Cons

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Concordant Crossroads</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rampaging Baloths</auto-card-image>
</div>

I'm quite happy with my Progenitus plan, but just in case, I added these two guys to potentially end the game in one turn.

With just one bounce land still in hand, <auto-card>Rampaging Baloths</auto-card> gets a 4/4 for each land drop I have (the bounce land bounces itself). Last game, that got up to around 8. And like <auto-card>Tatyova, Benthic Druid</auto-card>, it goes infinite with <auto-card>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card> + <auto-card>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card> (or it's many functional reprints)

# Conclusion

I'm excited about the changes I've made, but there's also a strong worry that I've just made a degenerate, uninteractive, monster of a deck. At least now, the games should be mercifully shorter!

Until next time, happy brewing!
