This week night I was to play three games with the new <auto-card name="Azorius Chancery">Bounce Lands</auto-card> deck I've been brainstorming on this [blog](/2018-05-11-edh-changes-karoo).

I feared I had made an unstoppable monster, when instead I lost all three games.

Let's go back to the drawing board!

## Breakdown

The first game, I was one turn away from comboing out with <auto-card>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card>, then had a miniature stroke and wheeled it away because I was so distracted by mana-math. Discouraging, but that's on me. Other than that, the combo of <auto-card>Armageddon</auto-card> + <auto-card>Heroic Intervention</auto-card> worked splendidly.

As for the second and third games, I was able to stall enough with bounce to resolve Progenitus, only to lose the next turn. I guess if you just bounce away your problems, they eventually come back to bite you!

We need to add some more interaction. So how can we make room?

## Cutting the Group Hug

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Kynaios and Tiro of Meletis</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Ghirapur Orrery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rites of Flourishing</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Tempt with Discovery</auto-card-image>
</div>

If my whole gameplan is to reset the board + rebuild faster, why am I sharing the tools? I have enough of these effects duplicated elsewhere, I can afford to cut the ones that actively undermine my advantage.

## Cutting the non-Bounce Ramp

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Farseek</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Spoils of Victory</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Skyshroud Claim</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Ranger's Path</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Hunting Wilds</auto-card-image>
</div>

The bounce lands + draw is generally good enough, and I felt bad devoting turns (and tempo) to these spells. So far, with 10 fetches and the aforementioned draw, I haven't really needed the fixing.

I am adding in Hour of Promise because it guarantees me two bounce lands, which can then bounce other lands back to my hand to take full advantage of the deck's signature <auto-card>Exploration</auto-card> effects.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Hour of Promise</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Upgrading the Courser

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Courser of Kruphix</auto-card-image>
</div>

The life gain was nice but negligible, so Swapping Courser for Future Sight feels like a strict upgrade (yes, UUU is a non-trivial cost but I'm optimistic).

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Magus of the Future</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Future Sight</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Swaps and Graveyard Tricks

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Concordant Crossroads</auto-card-image>
</div>

After straight up losing a game thanks to my own Concordant Crossroads (mass bounce is less good when the opponents have perma-haste), I decided to swap in a Haste enabler that's one-sided.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Anger</auto-card-image>
</div>

Considering half of my wheels discard my hand, it's not impossible to get him into the graveyard. Still, it gave me an excuse to run these two spicy tutors:

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Final Parting</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Jarad's Orders</auto-card-image>
</div>

Final Parting is nice because it can setup a wheel for later via <auto-card>Commit / Memory</auto-card>. And while I was adding cute graveyard tech, I decided to swap out the least impressive mass bounce spell, Devastation Tide, for the generally more versatile Kederekt Leviathan.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Devastation Tide</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Kederekt Leviathan</auto-card-image>
</div>

Lastly, since I was adding two tutors, I decided to cut Knowledge Exploitation. I'm less likely to find the big effects I want (wheels, Armageddon) in an opponent's deck.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Knowledge Exploitation</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Adding More Answers

As noted above, the main lesson learned was that mass bounce, though versatile, wasn't a true answer. Cutting the ramp spells opened up a lot of space, so I tried to focus on spells that would sweep the board but leave a resolved Progentius unscathed.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Pernicious Deed</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Gaze of Granite</auto-card-image>
</div>

Like <auto-card>Displacement Wave</auto-card> (which is in the deck already), Penicious Deed and Gaze of Granite can answer most of the board while conveniently missing my 10-cost Commander.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Blasphemous Act</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Duneblast</auto-card-image>
</div>

Progenitus's signature "protection from everything" prevents the damage dealt by Blasphemous Act, while still allowing me to "choose" it for Duneblast. If this effect proves to be good, I can also throw in <auto-card>Kindred Dominance</auto-card> later.

## Other Fun Stuff

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Sire of Insanity</auto-card-image>
</div>

Sire of Insanity feels like a big missed opportunity on my first pass. If the idea is to get ahead then lock out my opponents, Sire does double duty by removing any big hands I gave my opponents from wheels and then keeping them that way.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Finest Hour</auto-card-image>
</div>

This is an experiment, to really lean on Progenitus as my win-con. It's one of the few cards that gets around his protection to turn him into a 1-shot kill (with 23 Commander damage).

## In Conclusion

We shall see if the mix of less Group Hug, more answers, and little bit of tutoring will be enough to make this deck competitive.

Until next time, happy brewing!
