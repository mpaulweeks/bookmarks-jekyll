## Breakdown

The lands swaps were just upgrades. Pretty straightforward.

The rest is cutting individual cards that under performed, and replacing them with some new ideas.

## Cuts

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Deranged Assistant</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Millikin</auto-card-image>
</div>

I really want to hit turn 2 ramp for a turn 3 Ephara. I really want mana dorks in general, since they trigger Ephara draws and serve as foot soldiers in the game winning "Overrun".

But given how toolbox-centric this deck is, and how few win-cons we run, the self-mill is just too risky.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Infinite Reflection</auto-card-image>
</div>

The deck is starved for win-cons, but this was just dead too often.

1. I don't have any good non-Legendary targets, so it's strictly random chance that the board has a good target like <auto-card>Inferno Titan</auto-card>
2. Most of my creatures provide a unique utility. Why would I want to turn that off?

After sitting dead in hand game after game, it's getting cut.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Thraben Doomsayer</auto-card-image>
</div>

Thraben has been borderline for a while. The guaranteed draw and bodies sounds nice, but the problem is that he costs a 3 (a lot for a deck that wants to Draw Go every turn) and is best case a Phyrexian Arena that dies to wrath. I think I'd rather have more options at instant speed than commit to a creature with such gradual payoff.

## Adds

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Knight of the White Orchid</auto-card-image>
</div>

White "tax tutors" like this should reliably produce ramp now that my playgroup has much more Green players. I'm looking to add <auto-card>Oreskos Explorer</auto-card> as soon as I can pick up a copy.

The ability to tutor up either <auto-card>Prairie Stream</auto-card> or <auto-card>Mistveil Plains</auto-card> is gravy.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Unwind</auto-card-image>
</div>

Rebels present a much needed solution to the perenial problem of "draw go" mana management. Picture this:you leave up a bunch of mana, but nobody plays anything worth countering or killing. You wasted that mana, your turn, and precious tempo. Rebels solve this problem by giving me a reliable, instant-speed mana sink. I'm more than happy to spend 4 mana during the End Step to tutor in another creature.

Naturally, cards like require lots of mana upfront but turn out free, like <auto-card>Rewind</auto-card>, fit perfectly into this strategy. Counter first, rebel second.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Nimble Obstructionist</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Hushwing Gryff</auto-card-image>
</div>

Anything with Flash and Flying is an easy sell. Worst case, they surprise chump block an Angel and draw me a card doing it.

For Nimble, I'm excited to have a <auto-card>Stifle</auto-card> that cantrips and can't be countered.

Hushwing is an experiment. At the risk of turning off <auto-card>Saltskitter</auto-card>, <auto-card>Whitemane Lion</auto-card>, <auto-card>Stonecloaker</auto-card>, and the newly added <auto-card>Knight of the White Orchid</auto-card>, I get a instant-speed answer to a lot of powerful staples.

<ul>
  <li><auto-card>Avenger of Zendikar</auto-card></li>
  <li><auto-card>Craterhoof Behemoth</auto-card></li>
  <li><auto-card>Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</auto-card> (stops most of the combos)</li>
  <li><auto-card>Prime Speaker Zegana</auto-card></li>
  <li><auto-card>Bane of Progress</auto-card></li>
  <li><auto-card>Sepulchral Primordial</auto-card></li>
</ul>

The list goes on. <auto-card>Torpor Orb</auto-card> is a prison standard, and can singlehandedly ruin entire decks (rip <auto-card name="Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge">Jeleva</auto-card>). But whereas Torpor Orb just forces players to hold those cards until it's safe, Hushwing can flash out and catch them in the act, after they've committed the mana!

Note: Ephara triggers on upkeep, so the deck's primary engine is unaffected.
