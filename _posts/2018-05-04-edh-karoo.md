This is a new / ongoing series where I detail my thought process when building and modifying EDH decks.

My first ever EDH commander was <auto-card>Scion of the Ur-Dragon</auto-card>, and I was working with a limited card pool and tight budget. As a result, I ran the full ten Bounce Lands, aka the Ravnica <auto-card>Karoo</auto-card>s.

<div class="center mtg-small">
  <auto-card-image>Azorius Chancery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Boros Garrison</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Dimir Aqueduct</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Golgari Rot Farm</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Gruul Turf</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Izzet Boilerworks</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Orzhov Basilica</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rakdos Carnarium</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Selesnya Sanctuary</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Simic Growth Chamber</auto-card-image>
</div>

The upsides to these lands are many:

- They provide card advantage - one land drop, two mana sources
- They allow you to "blink" your lands, like resetting the counters on a <auto-card>Glacial Chasm</auto-card>
- They play well with <auto-card name="Voyaging Satyr">cards that untap lands</auto-card>, producing more mana than usual

At the time, I ran a few cards that played well with the manabase, and it was always a pleasant surprise when the stars aligned.
<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Garruk Wildspeaker</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Frantic Search</auto-card-image>
  <div class="img-comment">back when Amulet of Vigor was Standard bulk</div>
</div>


So what is that was my central gameplan?

## Enter Karoo.dec

The decision to create a deck revolving around Bounce Lands comes from two events:

1. My <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/maro-speaker-v3-final/">Maro/Zegana</a> deck that reliably dumped absurd amounts of lands into play
2. My meta increasingly favoring <auto-card name="Cultivate">land-based</auto-card> ramp strategies
3. The recently printed <auto-card>Fall of Thran</auto-card>

My current guess is this: if I can resolve land destruction like <auto-card>Fall of Thran</auto-card> in a deck full of Bounce lands, backed with a general game plan that rebuilds mana bases quickly, I should be able to manufacture enough advantage to win the game.

## The Commander

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Jodah, Archmage Eternal</auto-card-image>
</div>

I needed a five color commander to run all 10 Bounce Lands. Most of the WUBRG color commanders are just big bodies, and don't offer much utility. Jodah will help me power out some of my big control spells that you'll see later, but really, the deck isn't built around him at all, and I could see slotting in <auto-card>Progenitus</auto-card> instead for the win-con.

## The Manabase

So ten bounce lands. Check.

Given that this is a five color deck, my collection has since grown, and Landfall Matters, I decided to stick close to the "perfect manabase".

Start with all 10 duals and 10 fetches. Then, because I run a lot of "Forest" tutors, add all the shocks and cycling lands available.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Breeding Pool</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Overgrown Tomb</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Stomping Ground</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Temple Garden</auto-card-image>

  <auto-card-image>Scattered Groves</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sheltered Thicket</auto-card-image>
</div>

By that same logic, throw in a <auto-card>Krosan Verge</auto-card>, and round it off to ~40 with a few ETB utility lands.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Krosan Verge</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Bojuka Bog</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Halimar Depths</auto-card-image>
</div>

We can reuse the <auto-card>Bojuka Bog</auto-card> and <auto-card>Halimar Depths</auto-card> thanks to the bounce lands! It may seem slow, but we'll have land acceleration to spare.

## About those Forests

I want to ramp and color fix since I'm five colors. But given the constraints of my mana base, the usual all-stars like <auto-card>Kodama's Reach</auto-card> won't work. Instead, we tutor for "Forests".

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Ranger's Path</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Hunting Wilds</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Skyshroud Claim</auto-card-image>
</div>

We can also grab non-Forests by name, or just straight up non-basics.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Farseek</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Tempt with Discovery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Realms Uncharted</auto-card-image>
</div>

Given our graveyard recursion and general strategy, I think the correct play for non-basic tutors is to always grab Bounce Lands.

## Graveyard Recursion

Knowing we run fetch lands, and that we like to blow things up, we want to re-use whatever we can. Thankfully, we've got a couple options now.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Life from the Loam</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Crucible of Worlds</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Muldrotha, the Gravetide</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Land Acceleration

So given the graveyard recursion, and that Bounce Lands require another land drop to replay what was bounced, how to do play all these lands?

We've got two categories of land acceleration. The first ones increase the total land drops possible. These play nicely with <auto-card name="Crucible of Worlds">Crucible</auto-card> and <auto-card name="Ramunap Excavator">friends</auto-card>.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Exploration</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Oracle of Mul Daya</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rites of Flourishing</auto-card-image>
</div>

The second category "cheats" them directly into play from our hand.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Burgeoning</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Kynaios and Tiro of Meletis</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card-image>
</div>

We can always use our normal land drops (from hand or graveyard) to play a Bounce land, then use <auto-card>Burgeoning</auto-card> and the like to cheat the bounced land back in.

Tappers like <auto-card>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card> are of particular note:

1. There are a number of functional reprints, allowing us a lot of redundancy
2. They all form a powerful combo with <auto-card>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card>

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Walking Atlas</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card-image>
  <div class="img-comment">Brother From Another <span class="strike">Mother</span> Zendikar</div>
</div>

With <auto-card name="Retreat to Coralhelm">Retreat</auto-card> out, you tap a creature, put in a land, then untap that creature. This can accomplish one of two things:

1. Dump all the lands from your hand into play
2. Put a Bounce Land into play, then have it bounce itself

The second loop gives you infinite landfall triggers, as well as infinite mana with <auto-card>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card> out.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Ob Nixilis, the Fallen</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Tatyova, Benthic Druid</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Let's not forget the Land Destruction

Part of the original conceit was that:

1. Our average land is worth more than theirs
2. We should be able to recover faster

So blowing up lands is good. But we still might need SOME mana to restart our engine. Rather than just running every <auto-card>Armageddon</auto-card> and <auto-card>Jokulhaups</auto-card> available, we want cards to play to our specific strengths.

### Strategy #1: My Finite Resources are Better than Yours

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Balancing Act</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Razia's Purification</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Natural Balance</auto-card-image>
</div>

If everyone's land counts become equal, we should be best positioned to produce more mana. We're also happy to sacrifice lands given our plentiful graveyard recursion.

### Strategy #2: I Can Rebuild Faster from a Soft Reset

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Fall of the Thran</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sunder</auto-card-image>
</div>

These are the times I'm both grateful and sad that <auto-card>Upheaval</auto-card> is banned. If we want to be particularly rude, we can follow up a <auto-card>Sunder</auto-card> with a <auto-card name="Windfall">wheel</auto-card>.

### Strategy #3: Ramp Fast then Pause The Game

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Ward of Bones</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Territorial Dispute</auto-card-image>
  <div class="img-comment">it only took me 2 years to find a deck for Territorial Dispute</div>
</div>

Both of these are about making a "fair" card one-sided. <auto-card>Ward of Bones</auto-card> works especially well given the small number of lands necessary to reach decent mana. <auto-card>Territorial Dispute</auto-card> can also be made one-sided, and continually fed, thanks to "cheats" like <auto-card>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card>.

## Rounding it out

So we've got our gameplan. How do we make this a deck?

We've got plenty of mana and maybe too much ramp, which means we need lots of draw to compensate. <auto-card>Wheels</auto-card> are particularly good for ramp decks like this where you're constantly dumping your hand onto the field, and the Wheels that discard can also feed future the <auto-card name="Crucible of Worlds">Crucible</auto-card>.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Wheel of Fortune</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Whispering Madness</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Time Spiral</auto-card-image>
</div>

"Free spells" like <auto-card>Time Spiral</auto-card> and <auto-card>Frantic Search</auto-card> also double as <auto-card name="Dark Ritual">rituals</auto-card> thanks to the bounce lands.

We also need interaction. This is where my buddy <auto-card name="Jodah, Archmage Eternal">Jodah</auto-card> finally comes in, allowing us to discount (as well as color fix) some game-changing Sorcery spells.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Decree of Pain</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Dread Cacodemon</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>In Garruk's Wake</auto-card-image>
  <div class="img-comment">not-pictured: medium cost answers to artifacts/enchantments</div>
</div>

## In Conclusion

We'll see how powerful (or fragile) this deck is when I test it next week, but it was lot of fun to build and write about! You can find the current list on my <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/jodah-the-vigorous/">TappedOut</a>.

Until next time, happy brewing!
