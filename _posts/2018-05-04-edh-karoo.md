This is a new / ongoing series where I detail my thought process when building and modifying EDH decks.

So, my first ever EDH commander was <auto-card>Scion of the Ur-Dragon</auto-card>, and I was working with a limited card pool and tight budget. As a result, I ran the full ten <auto-card>Karoo</auto-card> lands (aka Bounce Lands) from Ravnica.

<div class="center mtg-small">
  <auto-card-image>Azorius Chancery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Boros Garrison</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Dimir Aqueduct</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Golgari Rot Farm</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Gruul Turf</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Izzet Boilerworks</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Orzhov Basilica</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rakdos Carnarium</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Selesnya Sanctuary</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Simic Growth Chamber</auto-card-image>
</div>

The upsides to these lands are many:

- They provide card advantage (one land drop, two mana sources)
- They allow you to blink your lands, like resetting the counters on a <auto-card>Glacial Chasm</auto-card>
- They play well with <auto-card name="Voyaging Satyr">cards that untap lands</auto-card>, producing more mana than usual

At the time, I ran a few otherwise good cards in that deck that played well with this particular manabase.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Garruk Wildspeaker</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Frantic Search</auto-card-image>
</div>

It was always a pleasant surprise when the stars aligned and I rapidly accelerated my mana.

So what is that was my central gameplan?

## Enter Karoo.dec

The decision to create a deck revolving around Bounce Lands comes from two events:

1. My successful <a href="https://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/maro-speaker-v3-final/">Maro/Zegana</a> deck that reliably dumped absurd amounts of lands into play
2. My meta increasingly favoring <auto-card name="Cultivate">land-based</auto-card> ramp strategies
3. The recently printed <auto-card>Fall of Thran</auto-card>

My current guess is this: if I can resolve land destruction like <auto-card>Fall of Thran</auto-card> in a deck full of Bounce lands, plus with a general game plan that rebuilds mana bases quickly, I should be able to manufacture enough advantage to win the game (somehow).

## The Commander

<auto-card>Jodah, Archmage Eternal</auto-card>

I needed a 5 color commander to run all 10 Bounce Lands. Most of the 5 color commanders are just big bodies. Jodah will help me power out some of my big control spells that you'll see later, but really, the deck isn't built around him at all.

## The Manabase

So ten bounce lands. Check.

Given that this is a 5 color deck, my collection has since grown, and Landfall Matters, I decided to stick close to the "perfect manabase".

Start with 10 duals and 10 fetches. Then, because I run a lot of "Forest" tutors, add all the shocks and cycling lands available.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Breeding Pool</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Overgrown Tomb</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Stomping Ground</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Temple Garden</auto-card-image>

  <auto-card-image>Scattered Groves</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sheltered Thicket</auto-card-image>
</div>

By that same logic, throw in a Krosan Verge, and round it off to 40 lands with a few ETB utilities.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Krosan Verge</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Bojuka Bog</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Halimar Depths</auto-card-image>
</div>

We can reuse the Bojuka Bog and Halimar Depths thanks to the bounce lands! It may seem slow, but we'll have land acceleration to spare.

## About those Forests

I want to ramp, and be able to color fix, but given the constraints of my mana base, the usual all-stars like <auto-card>Kodama's Reach</auto-card> won't work. Instead, we tutor for "Forests".

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Ranger's Path</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Hunting Wilds</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Skyshroud Claim</auto-card-image>
</div>

We can also grab non-Forests by name, or just straight up non-basics.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Farseek</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Tempt with Discovery</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Realms Uncharted</auto-card-image>
</div>

Given our graveyard recursion, I think the correct play on Realms Uncharted is just always grab four Bounce Lands.

## Graveyard Recursion

Knowing we run fetch lands, and that we like to blow up lands, we should be able to re-use those puppies. Thankfully, we've got a couple options now.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Life from the Loam</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Crucible of Worlds</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Muldrotha, the Gravetide</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Land Acceleration

So given the recursion, and that Bounce Lands require another land drop to reply the "bouncee", how to do play all these lands?

We've got two categories of land acceleration. The first ones increase the total land drops possible. These play nicely with <auto-card name="Crucible of Worlds">Crucible</auto-card>, though are often double-sided.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Exploration</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Oracle of Mul Daya</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Rites of Flourishing</auto-card-image>
</div>

The second category "cheats" them directly into play from our hand.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Burgeoning</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Kynaios and Tiro of Meletis</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card-image>
</div>

We can always use our normal land drops (from hand or graveyard) to play a Bounce land, then use <auto-card>Burgeoning</auto-card> and friends to cheat the bounced land back in.

Tappers like <auto-card>Sakura-Tribe Scout</auto-card> are of particular note:

1. There are a number of functional reprints, allowing us a lot of redundancy
2. They all form a powerful combo with <auto-card>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card>

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Llanowar Scout</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Walking Atlas</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Retreat to Coralhelm</auto-card-image>
</div>

With Retreat out, you tap a creature, put in a land, then untap that creature. This can accomplish one of two things:

1. Dump all your lands into play
2. Put a Bounce Land into play, then have it bounce itself

The second situation gives you infinite landfall triggers, as well as infinite mana with Amulet of Vigor out.

<div class="center">
  <auto-card-image>Ob Nixilis, the Fallen</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Tatyova, Benthic Druid</auto-card-image>
  <auto-card-image>Amulet of Vigor</auto-card-image>
</div>

## Let's not forget the Land Destruction
