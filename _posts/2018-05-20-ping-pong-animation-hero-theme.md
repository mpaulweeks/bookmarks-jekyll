Something that fascinates me is scoring. Many television series or movies are elevated by their soundtracks, and even a few ruined by them. During a recent re-watch of Diebuster, I was struck by the seemingly competent scoring and how it utterly failed to make an impression. Compare this to it's predecessor Gunbuster, whose main theme was used very effectively (if maybe too often and bluntly).

How many times have I watched a movie or show, only to find myself listening to its soundtrack on loop the follow week? In almost all cases, it retroactively boosts my appreciation for the original work. Everytime I listen to Diva from Blood+ or Shangri-la from Noein, it generates nostalgia for an otherwise forgettable work. Not to mention the catchy OPs or inserts, which on repeat listens inevitably erode criticism or misgivings I had about the source material.

However, this fondess for music is largely due to the music itself, regardless of it's significance or usage. One extreme example: in my early love of Escaflowne and Cowboy Bebop, I decided to seek out anything else composed by Yoko Kanno. I now regularly listen to and enjoy the soundtracks for both Brain Powerd and Turn A Gundam despite having never seen either show.

Today, I don't want to take about those songs. I want to talk about when score works with the action on screen to create something wonderous and unique. I want to dive into motifs and their importance on our connection with the characters and themes.

I want to talk about Ping Pong the Animation.

Ping Pong already has a strong backing score. The music often matches the emotion of the scene, from pumped up action to quiet sadness.

Each main character has an easily distinguishable "theme song" that follows them from their introduction through their arc.

Some characters even have multiple themes for different scenarios, connected via a similar melody or instrumentation. Kong's character theme is bouncy, foreign, and proud. When playing a match, it reflects his cut-throat desire to win and razor-sharp focus.

Compare this to Koizumi, whose piano arpeggios reflect an old man's wisdom. When things get competitive, the key switches to the minor mode. The arpeggios have become foreboding, as he tries to teach Smile a bitter lesson.

That said, as impressive and effective as these motifs are, nonething compares to the Hero's Theme and how it is set up, reinforced, then paid off.

The first episode has to a do a lot of heavy lifting fast, both to establish the broad cast of characters and seed the themes that will run thorough the show. Starting in the cold open and then mixed throughout the episode, we see glimpses of the hero. "Chant his name three times, then he will appear!"

![](images/ping-pong/e01_chant.png)

In what seems unrelated on first viewing, Smile hums a simple tune a few times in the episode. After getting skunked by Kong in the episode's climax, Peco asks Smile about it:

> Peco: What's that?
>
> Smile: Monster Robot
>
> Peco: I mean the song.
>
> Smile: Is it weird?
>
> Peco: A little.

<video file="e01_hero_theme.mp4"></video>

Peco doesn't recognize his own theme song, mirroring how he's lost sight of what drove him as a child and made him the hero.

The reinforcement comes during Smile's tournament match vs Kong Wenge in episode 3. At this point, the coach has convinced him to start practicing and has starting sharpening his competitive edge. Smile has not yet transformed fully into the ruthless robot.

Smile starts of his match with Konge on the backfoot, but this doesn't discourage him. Yes we see some of the "mechnical" imagery as he downloads his opponent, but as Smile makes his comeback he is humming the same old tune. He is focused, he is trying, and he's having fun.

<video file="e03_humming.mp4"></video>

The stronger Smile gets, the more at peace he seems. He is approaching enlightenment, while Peco as spectator becomes jealous and confused. Peco doesn't recognize his friend Smile. He was supposed to be the hero, right? After getting skunked by Kong just two episodes prior, Peco's only words are:

> No way... Is [Smile] going to win?

The final turn of this battle is when an already demoralized Kong Wenge gets chewed out by his coach, who is also his translator and only friend. Smile cannot understand the Mandarin but clearly gets the gist of it.

<video file="e03_yelling.mp4"></video>

Immediately, Smile is shown to lose his drive. Like his many games with Peco, he can't help but go easy on someone who "bases their life around Ping Pong", something he describes to Kazuma in that same episode as "disgusting".

<video file="e03_creepy.mp4"></video>

The show quickly skips to the inevitable conclusion: Smile caves and hands the game to Kong. After this match and Koizumi's strong scolding, Smile transforms fully into the "emotionless" robot. For the next several episodes, he doesn't hesistate to crush even former friends like Sakuma. Witnessing this, Peco is finally so discouraged he throws away his ping pong paddle.

<video file="e05_paddle.mp4"></video>

With Peco hitting rock bottom in his own existential crisis, it's fitting that the Hero's Theme completely disappears. That is, until Peco's enlightenment and return to form.

With a peptalk from Sakuma and off-screen revelation (later revealed to be Smile's enthusiastic grin in an old photo), Peco throws himself into training. He is finding himself again, but has not regained Hero status just yet. In the climatic tournament of the series, we see him breeze through his early opponents. Peco gets a cathartic rematch with Kong Wenge in episode 9 that also serves to conclude Kong's arc and show his growth and maturity. You can hear the same theme music as their first match from episode one, bringing their relationship full circle.

<video file="e08_kong_rematch.mp4"></video>

Smile can't help but notice Peco is back.

<video file="e08_peco_returns.mp4"></video>

But the theme doesn't return for another two episodes. Why? Because Peco is still missing something, and he hasn't figured it out yet.

It is during the semi-finals match against Kazama that Peco is truly tested. After quicking losing 4 points in a very convincing fashion, Peco thinks this is his lowest point. His triumphant moment! He openly declares the start of his comeback.

<video file="e10_false_return.mp4"></video>

He announces the Hero's arrival, only to be immediately shut down and then lectured. Kazama, a veteran burdened by his success, can't stomach Peco's naivete. This false start is important, and shows that Peco is still be foolish, egoistic, and unaware. He continues to struggle and quickly loses the first two games.

Finally, at his lowest point, Peco remembers that key bit of wisdom from his childhood. It's not about being the best, the strongest, the hero. It's so much more pure than that! It turns out... Ping Pong is fun!

<video file="e10_peco_epiphany.mp4"></video>

During this epiphany, we hear Smile's old humming tune slowly fade in. We see a flashback that explains it's origins - Smile wrote it for Peco, as the Hero's theme! But as recently as episode 1, Peco had forgotten it. Now through flashback, we hear the original rendition: through the voice of a child.

The theme has been setup, reinforced, and reincorporated. But now for the real payoff.

Up until this point, Peco hasn't had a definable song that was his own. His matches would highlight the theme of his opponents, and his slower scenes borrowed from the standard library of background score. This is the true payoff of the show. On the official soundtrack, this song is titled simply, "Peco".

<video file="e10_peco_theme.mp4"></video>

Hero Kenzan! The action zips by. The background and spectators, even the colors, start to fade as the two players become increasingly focused and wholly absorbed by the game. And nowhere is this sudden transformation as clear and apparent as the score.

Peco's theme is exploding with sincere exuberance. The almost-lullaby tune we heard from Smile earlier, with a faster tempo and interesting arrangement, transforms into a spontaneous assault of sounds. Peco's theme is childish, with the squeaking flute and bells and whistles. Peco's theme is spirited, with the vocal ooo-ing and echoing and the occasional clapping on the beat. Peco's theme is solid and powerful, with the electronic drone to center the chord alongside the strong percussive beat.

Even more, we can appreciate this song's different manifestations / interpretations / arrangements as reflections of each character. Peco's theme mirrors his best qualities and aspirations (as described above), while Smile's slower lullaby more acurately represent his needs: the hero as protector and savior, an answer to the external noise and bullying, less a drug and more a salve.

What I love in particular about this motif is how it transitions from diagetic to non-diagetic, ie from occuring within the reality of the show to becoming the supporting score. For a quick primer on Diagesis, check out this segment from [Linday Ellis's review of Phantom of the Opera](https://youtu.be/-m5I_5Vnh6A?t=5m56s).

Motifs can be powerful things, for building emotional connections to the art or baking narrative associations into the subtext. But so rarely so you see a motif modified, let alone "adapted", like the Hero's theme in Ping Pong. Not only was it expertly set up both in timing and secrecy, but the moment when understand and emotion come together in the narrative and the score synthesizes in response is unprecedented and deeply powerful.

I could write so many posts about this show, let alone this. On top of the music, we also see visual motifs reincorporated and combined so quickly and effectively it becomes hypnotic.

But for now, we'll call it a day. I hope I have shared with you have a profound appreciation for the scoring in Ping Pong!

If you have a favorite show or movie, where you feel the score greatly elevated the storytelling, please drop me a line <a href="https://twitter.com/mpaulweeks">@mpaulweeks</a>! I'd love to hear about it.
