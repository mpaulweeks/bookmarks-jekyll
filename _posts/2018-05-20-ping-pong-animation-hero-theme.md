Something that fascinates me is scoring. Many television series or movies are elevated by their soundtracks, and even a few ruined by them. During a recent re-watch of Diebuster, I was struck by the seemingly competent scoring and how it utterly failed to make an impression. Compare this to it's predecessor Gunbuster, whose main theme was used very effectively (if maybe too often and bluntly).

How many times have I watched a movie or show, only to find myself listening to its soundtrack on loop the follow week? In almost all cases, it retroactively boosts my appreciation for the original work. Everytime I listen to Diva from Blood+ or Shangri-la from Noein, it generates nostalgia for an otherwise forgettable work. Not to mention the catchy OPs or inserts, which on repeat listens inevitably erode criticism or misgivings I had about the source material.

However, this fondess for music is largely due to the music itself, regardless of it's significance or usage. One extreme example: in my early love of Escaflowne and Cowboy Bebop, I decided to seek out anything else composed by Yoko Kanno. I now regularly listen to and enjoy the soundtracks for both Brain Powerd and Turn A Gundam despite having never seen either show.

Today, I don't want to take about those songs. I want to talk about when score works with the action on screen to create something wonderous and unique. I want to dive into motifs and their importance on our connection with the characters and themes.

I want to talk about Ping Pong the Animation.

Ping Pong already has a strong backing score. The music often matches the emotion of the scene, from pumped up action to quiet sadness.

Each main character has an easily distinguishable "theme song" that follows them from their introduction through their arc.

But what really sets the show apart for me is the Hero's Theme, and how it is set up, reinforced, then paid off.

The first episode has to a do a lot of heavy lifting fast, both to establish the broad cast of characters and seed the themes that will run thorough the show. Starting in the cold open and then mixed throughout the episode, we see glimpses of the hero. "Chant his name three times, then he will appear!"

![](images/ping-pong/e01_chant.png)

In what seems unrelated on first viewing, Smile hums a simple tune a few times in the episode. After getting skunked by Kong in the episode's climax, Peco asks Smile about it:

> Peco: What's that?
>
> Smile: Monster Robot
>
> Peco: I mean the song.
>
> Smile: Is it weird?
>
> Peco: A little.

Peco doesn't recognize his own theme song, mirroring how he's lost sight of what drove him as a child and made him the hero.

The reinforcement comes during Smile's tournament match vs Kong Wenge in episode 3. At this point, the coach has convinced him to start practicing and has starting sharpening his competitive edge. Smile has not yet transformed fully into the ruthless robot.

Smile starts of his match with Konge on the backfoot, but this doesn't discourage him. Yes we see some of the "mechnical" imagery as he downloads his opponent, but as Smile makes his comeback he is humming the same old tune. He is focused, he is trying, and he's having fun.

The stronger Smile gets, the more at peace he seems. He is approaching enlightenment, while Peco as spectator becomes jealous and confused. Peco doesn't recognize his friend Smile. He was supposed to be the hero, right? After getting skunked by Kong just two episodes prior, Peco's only words are:

> No way... Is [Smile] going to win?

The final turn of this battle is when an already demoralized Kong Wenge gets chewed out by his coach, who is also his translator and only friend. Smile cannot understand the Mandarin but clearly gets the gist of it.

Immediately, Smile is shown to lose his drive. Like his many games with Peco, he can't help but go easy on someone who "bases their life around Ping Pong", something he describes to Kazuma in that same episode as "disgusting".

(screenshot)

The show quickly skips to the inevitable conclusion: Smile and hands the game to Kong. Kong accepts the victory but can't help but have his ego bruised. He suspects and resents Smile's pity.

ep3 11:32

After this match and Koizumi's strong scolding, Smile transforms fully into the "emotionless" robot. For the next several episodes, he doesn't hesistate to crush even former friends like Sakuma.

ep4 0:27

With Peco hitting rock bottom in his own existential crisis, it's fitting that the Hero's Theme completely disappears. That is, until Peco's enlightenment and return to form.

With a peptalk from Sakuma and off-screen revelation (later revealed to be Smile's enthusiastic grin in an old photo), Peco throws himself into training. He is finding himself again, but has not regained Hero status just yet. We see him breeze through his early opponent, getting a cathartic rematch with Kong Wenge in episode 9 that also serves to conclude Kong's arc and show his growth and maturity.

ep8 18:26 - 47

But this is still just Peco being Peco.

ep8 17:29

It is against Kazama that Peco is truly tested. At one point, he thinks this is his triumphant moment, the start of his comeback. He announces the Hero's arrival, only to immediately shut down and then lectured. Kazama, a veteran burdened by his success, who can't stomach Peco's naivete.

ep10 6:48 - 7:36

Finally, at his lowest point, Peco remembers that key bit of wisdom from his childhood. The defining trait that made him a hero back then. That Ping Pong is fun!

ep10 12:06 - 13:52

We hear Smile's tune again, along with a flashback that explains it's origins. He wrote it for Peco, as the Hero's theme! But as recently as episode 1, Peco had forgotten it. Now through flashback, we hear the original rendition: through the voice of a child.

(screenshot)

All this buildup culminates in an ecstatic climax. The action zips by. The background and spectators, even the colors, start to fade as the two players become increasingly focused and wholly absorbed by the game. And nowhere is this sudden transformation as clear and apparent as the score.

(clip through Dragon missing the shot)

Hero Kenzan! The Hero Appears, and now we hear _Peco's Theme_ (as titled in the soundtrack) in all it's sincere exuberance. The almost-lullaby tune we heard from Smile earlier turns into this high-energy, spontaneous assault of sounds. Peco's Theme is childish, with the squeaking flute and bells and whistles. Peco's Theme is spirited, with the vocal ooo-ing and echoing and the occasional clapping on the beat. Peco's Theme is solid and powerful, with the electronic drone to center the chrod, alongside the strong percussive beat.

(youtube embed to full track)

I want to clarify that Peco's Theme as presented in episode 10 is not necessarily the "true version" of the song. Given the logic of the story, and the song's <a href="">non-diagetic presentation</a> (unlike Smile's humming), I prefer the think of the Hero Theme as a simple catchy tune improvised by a child. Continuing this logic, we can appreciate it's different manifestations, interpretations, arrangements, as reflections of each character. Peco's Theme mirrors his best qualities and aspirations, while Smile's slower lullaby more acurately represent his needs: the hero as protector and savior, an answer to the external noise and bullying, less a drug and more a salve.

(smile saved from locker)

The visual metaphors continue. Peco's enthusiasm is so infestious it begins infest Kazama, leading to a wonderfully symbolic scene. Kazama is constantly depicted as climbing an infitely tall wall, his monologue in the episode describing the detail the burden of winning. His path has no discrete goal or finish line, only the possibility of failure. Thus when he sees Peco fly past him, he finally ceases the endless climbing and tries something new. He breaks the cycle, and finally sees the hero.

(clip of peco kazama scene)

Except the Hero cannot help him directly, only show him the way. Kazama sprouts wings and escapes his self-imposed mental prison. Finally taking flight marks the resolution of another thread, mimiced in the final line of the episode. "People can fly"

(screenshot)

Kazama adamantly declares throughout the episode: "people can't fly". This both summarizes his feeling trapped in the cycle of endless victories, as well as deeper emotional trauma surrounding his father. The flashback imply Kazama's father commited by suicide, and this combined with intense familiar pressure to conform to a specific role bind him to the earth.

Yet even as he's about to lose Peco, he no longer cares. Not due to depression or an invalidation of his beliefs, but rather the epiphany that he doesn't have to be shackled. He can be so much more. Life can be so much more. "People really can fly"



What I love in particular about this motif is how it transitions from diagetic to non, ie from occuring within the reality of the show to becoming the supporting score. For a quick primer on Diagesis, check out this segment from [Linday Ellis's review of Phantom of the Opera](https://youtu.be/-m5I_5Vnh6A?t=5m56s).
