# Character Growth in Beverly Hills Cop

What character arcs, if any, exist in the 1984 smash hit Beverly Hills Cop?

![](foley)

Our main character, Axel Foley, is completely static.

He starts the story as intelligent and good-hearted cop who doesn't play by the rules. He is punished for this. Does he learn a lesson? No, because according to the plot of the movie, Axel has been right all along, so why should he change?

Foley is aware of the rules; he breaks them by choice, and follows them when it is to his advantage. His behavior doesn't change throughout the movie. This is most pointedly reinforced by the two "what really happened?" scenes.

Around the midpoint of the film, he stops a robbery at a strip club with the help of the two cops tailing him, Taggart and Rosewood. When questioned at the precinct by Lieutenant Bogomil as to why Taggart and Rosewood were in a strip club in the first place, Foley fabricates a cover story that plausibly covers for his fellow cops, if a little hyperbolic and insincere with how much Foley praises his fellow officers.

Lieutent Bogomil asks "Is that what really happened? Would someone like to tell me what really happened?"

Taggart's sense of honor and duty gets the best of him, and he admits the less flattering truth. A large theme of the LA Police (as depicted) is a strict adherence to the rules, and Taggart is shown as doing the right thing. Foley chastises him immediately, in front of his superior Bogomil, for telling the truth:

"The supercop story was working. Okay? It was working, and you guys just messed it up. Okay? I'm trying to figure you guys out but I haven't yet. But it's cool. You fuckup a perfectly good lie..."

In the end, after the grand action climax wherein a lot of police bend the rules to catch (shoot) the villian, the Chief of Police demands to know what is happening. This time, Lieutenant Bogomil (who was previously shown to be obedient to the chief) creates the lie that covers everyone's asses.

Again, the Chief echoes Bogomil in asking "What really happened?"

Except this time, the line stands. Taggert agrees with it, and Foley struggles to hide his excited laughter at getting away with it. Not believing it, but satisfied nonetheless with the explanation, the Chief leaves and everyone lives happily ever after.

The lesson of the scene, and the film, is clear: bend the rules.

For better or worse though, Foley has been doing this the entire time. His character simply does not grow.

Foley being static doesn't need to be a bad thing. Stories often employ static characters to act as foils / catalysts for other characters - in this case, the LAPD.

Yes, Billy Rosewood becomes a little more courageous thorough the film, shooting (and probably killing) two men with a surprised look on his face. But the clear arc of the film as far as mirroring the message of the film belongs to Taggart (and Bogomil, to a lesser extent).

Seargent Taggart starts off as duty bound, if a little stubborn and bull-headed (he is provoked to violence by Foley in his first scene). That belligerence disappears after the scene, and Taggart mostly falls into the archetype of a "no-nonsense" cop. Unlike Billy, he refuses the dinner ordered to their car when on stakeout for Foley. He refuses to drink while on duty. But when duty calls, and Foley requests his help in the strip club robbery, he is professional and effective.

His growth is most explicitly stated in the same scene above that illustrates Foley's lack of growth - over the course of the film, he realizes the benefit of something bending the rules. This is not strictly related to getting good police work done, as he also loosens up in the final scene when claiming "one drink won't hurt" when on duty, much to Rosewood's surprise.

Foley is the focus point of the movie, the attraction, the fun, and even though the plot and emotions revolve around his journey to avenge his dead friend, Taggart and Rosewood serve as the true heart of the film.
