I just finished reading My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness for second time.

When I first encountered Nagata Kabi's journal-turned-book back in May of 2017, it resonated with me immediately. I consider it the most emotionally moving book I read that year.

In my fervor to recommend the books to friends, I often found myself having to explain the salacious title and cover art. My favorite example (to demonstrate the value of the work) was the author's brief page or two on self-harm. As someone who has (luckily) never been in that mind space, it really helped me to empathize with those who have. I had heard analogies before, and the idea of being in control of the pain, but her specific observation about *externalizing* the pain, and creating a visible causal relationship, was eye-opening.

When I read this last year, I engaged with the work emotionally and nakedly. I felt the author's pain, I cheered at her success, and laughed (hopefully with her) at the self-deprecating humor.

I'll say it again, it moved me. But self-harm metaphor aside, not much stuck with me afterwards. Coming back to it now, I remembered the general shape of her life, but not the details, the lessons, the humor.

Reading it now, I was in awe of what the book had to say about self-acceptance. The author has written a narrative that provides a clear blueprint for how to grasp at personal fulfillment.

Disclaimer: I realize it can be unwise (potentially unhealthy) to try and map any sort of narrative onto REAL LIFE™️. I merely seek to examine the text, as if it were a piece of fiction, with the goal of learning from the trials and more trials and eventual tribulations of this character in this book, henceforth referred to as Nagato.

Moving on!

My favorite part of about the narrative is how much failure there is. Failure allows one to learn from their (or other's) mistakes. I also much prefer the strategy of "learning what not do", as it's often more actionable than "hey this worked for me, you try it!"

Nagato initially connects her depression with leaving school and, as a result, losing the place she belongs. Rather than confront the idea of being defined by external actors, she instead seeks to fill this void with coworkers

However, she soon realizes this was a false equivalence

She has a similarly hollow experience at a bakery, then lives with her parents in unemployment for quite some time. She eventually channels this free time and energy into manga and makes her debut, seemingly solving the problem.

However, the salvation is fleeting. The success carries with it new and exciting sources of stress and doubt.

It eventually gets the point that she seeks medical treatment, and it is immensely helpful. Around this time, she starts re-examining her relationship with her parents.

Nagato comes to realize that a large source of her low self-esteem comes from her relationship with her parents.

On a surface level, yes, they were often less than supportive.

But the important lesson Nagato learns from this isn't "Mother knows best" or "I'm cutting you out of my life". She realizes the true problem is how much she let herself rely on her parents approval, on their recognition. She describes and draws it almost like a split personality.

And this is the recurring theme. She spends these formative years trying to get validation and recognition from her peers, her audience, her parents. But this will never work! If she is constantly straining herself to appeal to her coworkers, to her audience, to her parents, how can she be at peace?

...

Through her autobiographical manga, Nagato finally achieves actualization through self-acceptance.

Yes, this is inextricably tied to the manga's success and the subsequent audience filling her need for connection, but she achieved similar external validation during her debut to no avail.

This time was different, in part because her autobiographical work was so tied to her identity. Her TRUE identity.

Now, this is not completely naive. It's not as trite as "be yourself". On the way she made significant changes and self-investments.

For all of her angst leading up to it, and ennui immediately afterwards, her initial visit to a prostitute was instrumental in demystifying sex and giving her the experience to channel into her art, and resulting self-exploration on page.

Let's not forget the several pages on personal hygiene and the realization that (a) it takes work and (b) it's worth it.

## notes

- job is where you belong, jk its a contract
- family expectations, and the cycle of guilt


Goals as fleeting
Job but no validation from parents
Debut but not easier
Sex but still hollow
