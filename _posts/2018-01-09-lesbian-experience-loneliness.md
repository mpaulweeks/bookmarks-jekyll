I just finished reading My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness for second time.

When I first encountered Nagata Kabi's journal-turned-book back in May of 2017, it resonated with me immediately. I consider it the most emotionally moving book I read that year.

In my fervor to recommend the books to friends, I often found myself having to explain the salacious title and cover art. My favorite example (to demonstrate the value of the work) was the author's brief page or two on self-harm. As someone who has (luckily) never been in that mind space, it really helped me to empathize with those who have. I had heard analogies before, and the idea of being in control of the pain, but her specific observation about *externalizing* the pain, and creating a visible causal relationship, was eye-opening.

When I read this last year, I engaged with the work emotionally and nakedly. I felt the author's pain, I cheered at her success, and laughed (hopefully with her) at the self-deprecating humor.

I'll say it again, it moved me. But self-harm metaphor aside, not much stuck with me afterwards. Coming back to it now, I remembered the general shape of her life, but not the details, the lessons, the humor.

Reading it now, I was in awe of what the book had to say about self-acceptance. The author has written a narrative that provides a clear blueprint for how to grasp at personal fulfillment.

Disclaimer: I realize it can be unwise (potentially unhealthy) to try and map any sort of narrative onto REAL LIFE™️. I merely seek to examine the text, as if it were a piece of fiction, with the goal of learning from the trials and more trials and eventual tribulations of this character in this book, henceforth referred to as Nagato.

Moving on!

My favorite part of about the narrative is how much failure there is. Failure allows one to learn from their (or other's) mistakes. I also much prefer the strategy of "learning what not do", as it's often more actionable than "hey this worked for me, you try it!"

...

The author finally achieves actualization through self-acceptance. Yes, this is inextricably tied to the manga's success and the subsequent audience filling her need for connection, but she achieved similar external validation during her debut to no avail.

This time was different, in part because her autobiographical work was so tied to her identity. Her TRUE identity.

Now, this is not completely naive. It's not as trite as "be yourself". On the way she made significant changes and self-investments.

For all of her angst leading up to it, and ennui immediately afterwards, her initial visit to a prostitute was instrumental in demystifying sex and giving her the experience to channel into her art, and resulting self-exploration on page.

Let's not forget the several pages on personal hygiene and the realization that (a) it takes work and (b) it's worth it.

## notes

- job is where you belong, jk its a contract
- family expectations, and the cycle of guilt


Goals as fleeting
Job but no validation from parents
Debut but not easier
Sex but still hollow
