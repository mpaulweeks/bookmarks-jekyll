> Motifs can be powerful things, for building emotional connections to the art or baking narrative associations into the subtext. But so rarely so you see a motif modified, let alone “adapted”, like the Hero’s theme in Ping Pong. Not only was it expertly set up both in timing and secrecy, but the moment when understand and emotion come together in the narrative and the score synthesizes in response is unprecedented and deeply powerful. When the melody moves from the diagetic humming of a child’s fantasy to the pulsating soundtrack of the big match, so does the story of the Hero transform into legend.

End it here.

I think you should steal from Lindsay Ellis and mention the thing where The Hobbit fucked up the scoring and play the Nazgul theme at the wrong time. Because that is hilarious.
