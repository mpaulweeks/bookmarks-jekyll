Didnt get reference to minor mode, didnt get connection of analysis to clip (arpeggio term is too jargony, check my privelege)

“Spoiler: peco doesnt recognize his theme” seems to contradict later statement that he adapts it. I didn’t bridge the gap between it being his theme all along, and/or that assumption is incorrect?

Clear up sentence about “Smile on the backfoot”, not clear who is doing what. Rephrase like “Smile is at a strong disadvantage”

For most of the article, sentence sets up the clip. “Smile sees conversation about Kong” doesnt feel set up in the same way. Also probably include clip for zoom, and comment on musical zoom cue

Is the peco vs kong clip helping the argument? Or just fun thing? Should cut it

Seed thesis earlier about Smile missing the hero, and the hero coming back, then launch into clips as argument that music supports
